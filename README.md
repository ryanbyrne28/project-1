# Tell Me a Joke 
A simple jquery ajax app pulling API data.




I implemented a simple joke generator using jquery and ajax to pull data from an API source with all the said jokes.

Some of the challenges I faced:
- Filtering the API with appropriate jokes
- Overall AJAX functionality 
- Not getting carried away with CSS features.

- ## Features

- Click a button to generate a random joke.



## Technologies Used 
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS



## Future Enhancements 
- Ability to input a keyword for jokes
- option for several part jokes
